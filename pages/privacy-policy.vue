    </p>

    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-5">
      4. HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED
    </h4>
    <p>
      4.1. Compiling your Order: Once you have selected the Products you wish to
      order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provided the other
      required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your
      Order by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order" or similar
      button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter
      and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you
      do so you will be entering into a contract with the Restaurant and errors
      cannot be corrected (subject to paragraph 4.2. below). Where you have not
      logged in or created an account previously, then you may have the option
      to continue with your Order as a guest. By electing to complete your Order
      as a guest, you are agreeing that ScanEating will create a temporary
      ScanEating guest account for you which will, unless otherwise stated in
      these Website Terms, be accessible only (a) from the device which you use
      to place the Order; and (b) for a period of up to twelve months following
      the date of the Order. Your access to your temporary guest account will
      expire on the “Expiry Date” which shall be the earlier of (i) the date
      falling six months after the date on which you last accessed the temporary
      guest account; (ii) the date falling twelve months after the date on which
      the temporary guest account was created; and (iii) the date on which you
      logout of your temporary guest account, or clear the cache on the device
      which you used when the temporary guest account was created.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.2. Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you have submitted your Order
      and your payment has been authorized, you will not be entitled to change
      or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer
      to paragraphs 4.4 and 5.6 for details of the process relating to rejected
      Orders and refunding of payment). If you wish to change or cancel your
      Order, you may contact our Customer Care team as described in paragraph
      6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to
      communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be
      able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your
      requests as they may have already started processing your Order.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.3. Payment authorization: Where any payment you make is not authorized,
      your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant
      Restaurant.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.4. Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your
      Order, we will send it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by
      email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Please
      note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any
      Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each confirm that you have
      a contract for the sale of Products with a Restaurant but does not
      necessarily mean that your Order will be fulfilled by the Restaurant. We
      encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any
      rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as
      reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. However,
      Restaurants have the ability to reject Orders at any time because they are
      too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. In doing so,
      Restaurants will be in breach of their agreement with you and any payment
      made in respect of the order will be returned to you in accordance with
      paragraph 5.6 below.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.5. Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and
      collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates.
      Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or
      will be available for collection within the estimated times.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.6. Commercial agency: For the avoidance of doubt, any orders processed
      by ScanEating through the Website are processed by ScanEating in its
      capacity as commercial agent of the relevant Restaurant.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-5">5. PRICE AND PAYMENT</h4>
    <p>
      5.1. VAT and delivery costs: Prices will be as quoted on the Website.
      These prices include VAT but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for
      delivery instead of collection) and any administration or service charge
      imposed by the Restaurant. These will be added to the total amount due
      where applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2. Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and
      it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. If the
      correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website,
      we will normally contact you before the relevant Order is dispatched. In
      such an event, neither we nor the relevant Restaurant is under any
      obligation to ensure that the Order is provided to you at the incorrect
      lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.3. Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted
      credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at
      the point of delivery to, or collection by, you.
    </p>

    <p>
      5.4. Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be
      required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery or
      collection as proof of identification and so that they can check that the
      card corresponds with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that
      from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments
      and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days
      to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit
      card.
    </p>

    <p>
      5.5. Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your
      Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognized by the Website
      and endorsed by ScanEating, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit
      card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms &amp; Conditions for the full
      terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount
      vouchers. Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your
      bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of the
      Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for between 3 to 5
      working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this
      amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period. The
      credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer
      transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or
      discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be
      released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance. You
      acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be
      responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or
      card issuer in the release of funds back into your account. Where you use
      the Website as a guest, any account credit which you accrue against your
      temporary guest account can only be redeemed for an Order placed via your
      temporary guest account and cannot be transferred for use on another
      account.
    </p>

    <p>
      5.6. Rejected Orders: Because of standard banking procedures, once you
      have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card
      and your payment has been authorized, your bank or card issuer will
      "ring-fence" the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently
      rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or
      cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer
      the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant
      amount back into your available balance. However, this may take between 3
      to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You
      acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be
      responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or
      card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-5">6. CUSTOMER CARE</h4>
    <p>
      6.1. General: Customer care is extremely important to us. Subject to
      paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our Customer Care team will therefore try to assist
      you where possible if you have any problems with your Order. You can
      contact our Customer Care team by clicking or selecting the "Need help?",
      "Help" or similar button or by calling the telephone number shown on the
      Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.2. Questions about your Order: If your Order is taking longer than
      expected or you have any other problems with your Order, you can contact
      our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our Customer Care
      Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on
      your query.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.3. Changing or cancelling your Order: If you wish to change or cancel
      your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorized,
      you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will
      attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.
      However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the
      Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may
      have already started processing your Order.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.4. Complaints or feedback: In the event that you are dissatisfied with
      the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant,
      please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and
      reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews") to reflect your experience.
      The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.5. Compensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any
      Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a
      refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you
      should contact the Restaurant directly to lodge your complaint and, where
      appropriate, follow the Restaurant's own complaint procedures. If you are
      unable to contact the Restaurant, or the Restaurant refuses to deal with
      your complaint, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above
      within 72 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care
      Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request
      compensation on your behalf. Please note, however, that the legal contract
      for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant
      that you place your Order with. We have no control over Restaurants and
      the quality of the Products or service that they provide, and we are not
      able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing,
      any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant.
